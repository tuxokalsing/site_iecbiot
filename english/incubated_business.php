						<p> Innovation, research, development and commitment to health are the pillars of Ziel Biosciences
						since the beginning of its operations. The company was founded in 2011 by three doctors seeking
						practical application of the knowledge acquired during their academic studies. The fact of working
						with research and dealing directly with cancer patients was the main motivation for the creation
						of the company. Observing the difficulties inherent in the management of cancer, we idealized the
						research and development of innovative solutions within the concept of individualized oncotherapy.</p>
												
						<p>Ziel Biosciences is divided in two main areas: research and development of innovative products 
						and provision of services, primarily in oncology.</p>

						<p>The company has two work focuses on research and development, one of the search by screening
						methods, diagnosis and prognosis of cancer, and another focused on the discovery of new therapeutic
						targets for cancer.</p>

						<p>When providing services, Ziel Biosciences has the molecular diagnosis in cancer team and provides
						services related to molecular and pharmaceutical companies interested in evaluating the effectiveness
						of new drugs that are still in pre-clinical and clinical phase.</p>
